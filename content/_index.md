I live in Cape Town, South Africa and most of my images are from this region. While I mainly look for birds to photograph I also enjoy photographing insects and flowers.

The portfolio sections of the site highlight some of my favorite images.
I really enjoy getting my images into prints and produce sets of coasters using my photographs, and you can see these in the products section.
I hope you enjoy your stay. :)
